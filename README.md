# Automatic join tool for multiple meeting platforms

This Python-Script can be used to join Webex, Zoom, Jitsi and BigBlueButton meetings automatically on linux. 
Meetings can be automatically recorded with OBS and the join time/date can be scheduled.

## Usage
**Arguments:**

-u: Url to meeting

-n: Name to display in meeting

-e Email to display

-d: Meeting duration in minutes

-s: Schedule Time/Date DDMMYYYYHHMM of meeting

-r: Flag to start recording with OBS

-i: Set flag if link leads to meeting invite page

-o: Flag if hotkeys are being used in OBS (ctrl alt s for stopping recording)

--dry: Dry run: Webex test website will open so you can configure OBS. Default duration 2 minutes

**Example:**

`./main.py -n "Your Name" -e Your@email.com  -d 90 -r -u "https://www.webex.com/de/test-meeting.html"`

**Configuration for OBS**

To use the recording feature, OBS has to be installed.
Use the script with only the --dry flag to open a Window and OBS. 
In OBS you can now select if the chromium Window or the whole screen should be used.
Use the -h flag and set ctrl alt s for stopping recording as hotkey in OBS. 
It works without if you use .mkv but .mp4 has problems without. 

**Dependencies**

Things that have to be installed:

- Open Broadcaster Software®
- chromium-chromedriver
- Python 3
- Selenium for python
- Pyautogui

**Requirements for Zoom**

This only works when zoom is installed locally.

These settings are needed:

In Zoom: Auto join meeting with audio (and maybe join mute)

in Browser: Always allow zoom.us to open links of this type (appears when joining manually)


## DISCLAIMER
There is no warranty for this software and the usage of it and its features is on your own risk.
